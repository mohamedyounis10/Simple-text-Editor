# Simple Text Editor

This is a simple text editor program implemented in C++. It allows users to perform basic text editing operations like appending text, deleting text, printing text, and undoing previous actions. The program utilizes a stack-based approach to manage text operations, providing users with a simple yet functional text editing experience.

## Features

- **Append Text**: Users can add new strings of text to the editor.
- **Delete Text**: Users have the option to delete the last character, a specified number of characters, or an entire string.
- **Print Text**: Users can view the current text content, either the entire string or specific characters at a given index.
- **Undo**: The program supports undo functionality, allowing users to revert the last operation performed.
- **Input Validation**: Input is validated to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., no empty spaces or digits).

## Usage

1. **Append Text**: Choose option 1 from the menu and input the desired text to append.
2. **Delete Text**: Select option 2 from the menu and specify whether to delete the last character, a certain number of characters, or an entire string.
3. **Print Text**: Use option 3 to print either the entire string or specific characters at a given index.
4. **Undo**: Option 4 allows users to undo the last operation performed.
5. **Exit**: Choose option 5 to exit the program.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary.

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o text_editor
./text_editor
```
